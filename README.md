# Advent of Code

As I'm currently in the process of learning Rust, I've decided to participate in Advent of Code to expand knowledge around the standard library as well as developing more idiomatic ways handle problems.

Once I finish with 2022's Advent of Code, I plan to go back to 2015 and add subsequent years as workspaces.

Hopefully by the end I'll have better knowledge of Rust. Or I'll still be as clueless as I currently am. Those are the options.
